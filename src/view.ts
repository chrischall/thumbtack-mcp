 * The rungs this server honours (`@chrischall/mcp-utils`' `view` vocabulary;
 * `chrischall/workflows` `docs/fleet-conventions.md`, "Response shape").
 *
 * A GROUNDED repo: it already had a field projection, and it was opt-in —
 * `compact: false`, so the caller had to know the slim rung existed and ask
 * for it. An efficiency that has to be requested is one that usually is not,
 * and the caller paying for it is the one least able to know.
 *
 * `compact` is the default now. Thumbtack payloads that have no projection get
 * media stripping instead, which needs no knowledge of the shape.
 *
 * A hand-written projection is NOT then media-stripped. Its field choices were
 * made WITH knowledge of the API; running a blind subtractive rule over its
 * output would let an un-grounded rule overrule a grounded one — which bit
 * viator-mcp, where the projection deliberately keeps a cover image.
 *
 * No `raw` rung: `full` already returns the untouched upstream payload.
